# Billing, Architecture, Security

##  Destroy your root account credentials, Set MFA, 


## Create an IAM user
- Sign in to the AWS Management Console with your root account credentials.
Navigate to the IAM service console.
- Click on the "Users" link in the left-hand menu and then click the "Add user" button.
- Enter a name for the user in the "User name" field.
- Select the "Programmatic access" and/or "AWS Management Console access" checkboxes to grant the user access to AWS resources via the AWS CLI, SDKs, or the AWS Management Console.
- If you select "AWS Management Console access", choose whether to create a custom password or allow the user to create their own password.
- Click "Next: Permissions".
- In the "Set permissions" step, you want to grant budget and cost alert permissions.
- Click on the "Permissions" tab and click the "Attach policies" button.
- In the search bar, search for "AWSBudgetsFullAccess" policy and select it.
- Click on "Attach policy".
The "AWSBudgetsFullAccess" policy grants the user full access to create, edit and delete budgets and also to receive budget notifications.
- Click "Next: Tags" to add tags to the user (optional).
- Click "Next: Review" to review your settings, and then click "Create user" to create the IAM user.


# To activate IAM user and role access to the Billing and Cost Management console
- Sign in to the AWS Management Console with your root user credentials (specifically, the email address and password that you used to create your AWS account).

- On the navigation bar, choose your account name, and then choose Account.

- Next to IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information, choose Edit.

- Select the Activate IAM Access check box to activate access to the Billing and Cost Management console pages.

- Choose Update.

# MFA
Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a security technology that requires multiple methods of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify a user's identity for a login or other transaction.
Never, ever, use your root account for everyday use. Instead, head to [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://youtu.be/OdUnNuKylHg?t=967) and create an administrator user. 

- Protect and lock your root credentials in a secure place 
You will absolutely want to activate Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) too for your root account. And you won’t use this user unless strictly necessary.

- Now, about your newly created admin account, activating MFA for it is a must. It’s actually a requirement for every user in your account if you want to have a security first mindset.

-  Now we set up MFA for the [user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html)

- we can login into our IAM user after inputing the MFA code

# Creat budget and CloudWatch alarm using CLI

## Getting the AWS CLI Working
We'll be using the AWS CLI often in this bootcamp,
so we'll proceed to installing this account.


### Install AWS CLI

- We are going to install the AWS CLI when our Gitpod enviroment lanuches.
- We are are going to set AWS CLI to use partial autoprompt mode to make it easier to debug CLI commands.
- The bash commands we are using are the same as the [AWS CLI Install Instructions]https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html


Update our `.gitpod.yml` to include the following task.

```sh
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```

We'll also run these commands indivually to perform the install manually

### Create a new User and Generate AWS Credentials

- Go to (IAM Users Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users) andrew create a new user
- `Enable console access` for the user
- Create a new `Admin` Group and apply `AdministratorAccess`
- Create the user and go find and click into the user
- Click on `Security Credentials` and `Create Access Key`
- Choose AWS CLI Access
- Download the CSV with the credentials

### Set Env Vars

We will set these credentials for the current bash terminal
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

We'll tell Gitpod to remember these credentials if we relaunch our workspaces
```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Check that the AWS CLI is working and you are the expected user

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see something like this:
```json
{
    "UserId": "AIFBZRJIQN2ONP4ET4EK4",
    "Account": "655602346534",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::655602346534:user/andrewcloudcamp"
}
```

## Enable Billing 

We need to turn on Billing Alerts to recieve alerts...


- In your Root Account go to the [Billing Page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/)
- Under `Billing Preferences` Choose `Receive Billing Alerts`
- Save Preferences


## Creating a Billing Alarm

### Create SNS Topic

- We need an SNS topic before we create an alarm.
- The SNS topic is what will delivery us an alert when we get overbilled
- [aws sns create-topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/create-topic.html)

We'll create a SNS Topic
```sh
aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
```
which will return a TopicARN

We'll create a subscription supply the TopicARN and our Email
```sh
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn TopicARN \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint your@email.com
```

Check your email and confirm the subscription

#### Create Alarm

- [aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html)
- [Create an Alarm via AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/)
- We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generated earlier
- We are just a json file because --metrics is is required for expressions and so its easier to us a JSON file.

```sh
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
```

## Create an AWS Budget

[aws budgets create-budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html)

Get your AWS Account ID
```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```

- Supply your AWS Account ID
- Update the json files
- This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json

```sh
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id AccountID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```
